* consider collapsing `src/adapters/application/mock-application.js` and `src/core/application.js`. There is common behaviour that we have to duplicate.
* put notification and toggle names in one place
* add marine weather
* allow snoozing

* don't show 'ask HN'

* add notification bubbles/change favicon when there are new items
* add icon showing whether the request was cached or not
* make it so you can go get a screenshot of the website as a preview
* why not use url as id? Filter would work across any source then.
* [bookmarks] add a keep icon where you can send it to remote storage
* try out [`jsonbase`](https://github.com/Devs-Garden/jsonbase)
